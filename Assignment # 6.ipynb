    "Question 1:\n",
    "Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Object Oriented programming is a programming style that is associated with the concept of Classess and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2:\n",
    "List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Following are the benefits of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Software complexity can be managed.\n",
    "2. Object Oriented program can easily be upgraded.\n",
    "3. it makes easy for the programmer to partition data.\n",
    "4. With Inheritance the programmer get friendly enviroment to execute and extend the code\n",
    "5. The data is secured\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 3:\n",
    "Differentiate between function and method?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method and a function are the same, with different terms. A method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming. A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4:\n",
    "Define the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1. Class:\n",
    "A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "2. Object:\n",
    "A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "3. Attribute:\n",
    "These attributes belong to the class itself, you can call them class variables.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class NewClass:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    attribute = \"This is an attribute of a class\"\n",
    "4. Behavior:\n",
    "The behavior of an object is defined by its methods, which are the functions and subroutines defined within the object class. Without class methods, a class would simply be a structure."
